# VISION - Two-Way Communication for Impaired People

**VISION** is a project aimed at enhancing communication for people with impairments, leveraging the power of Python programming. The project focuses on developing a two-way communication system that facilitates interaction between impaired individuals and others in a more accessible and efficient manner. By integrating technologies such as speech recognition, text-to-speech, and sign language recognition, VISION enables users to communicate effectively, whether they are hearing, speech, or visually impaired.

## Key Features

1. **Speech Recognition**:  
   Converts spoken words into text for individuals with hearing impairments.
   
2. **Text-to-Speech**:  
   Converts written text into speech to help individuals with visual or speech impairments.
   
3. **Sign Language Recognition**:  
   Recognizes sign language gestures and converts them into text or speech.
   
4. **Real-time Communication**:  
   Facilitates real-time conversation between impaired and non-impaired users through a seamless interface.

## Objective

VISION aims to break down communication barriers and provide equal access to interactive communication, enhancing social inclusion and independence for people with impairments.
